# Abstract
Here we write a shor summary of the paper and the principal results.


# Introduction
We have been receiving a number of warning messages via the Azure Portal. An invesitgation is conducted into each of the different types of security alert, use documented steps taken to remediate some of them (Johnson et al. 2017) and make recommendations made about others (based on Charlton et al. 2016).

# Security Concerns
Terry has investigated thoroughly the security breaches possible in cloud computing and safe storage of passwords. We combined this work with an investigation into the automatic alerts that are generated.

# Results
We found that implmenting some of the security recommendations had an extremely low overhead and could be applied at zero cost.

# Conclusions
Implementing 80% of the security alerts can be carried out with minimal effort and at very low cost. It is recommended that these are perfomed immediately. The other alerts can be environment dependent.
