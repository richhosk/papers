# Introduction
We have been receiving a number of warning messages via the Azure Portal. An invesitgation is conducted into each of the different types of security alert, use documented steps taken to remediate some of them (Johnson et al. 2017) and make recommendations made about others (based on Charlton et al. 2016). We expand on the Davis et al. paper from 2015 as well.
